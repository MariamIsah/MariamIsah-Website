Hello, my name is Mariam Isah. I am 20 years old, and I am currently attending the University of California Riverside as a Junior. The first professional experience I had was a shadowing experience at a hospital that my school offered. This was offered to me in my Junior year of high school and I jumped at this amazing offer. We wore scrubs, tied our hair, and really played the part of medical professionals.  I really believe this program helped me realize how fascinated and interested I was in the medical field. Although I forgot about the love I have for the medical field, I recently found it again. The site I was assigned to was the Martin Luther King Jr Community Hospital in Los Angeles. At this site, I was lucky enough to be able to shadow surgeons and watch a couple of surgeries. I remember watching a hernia surgery and I was so fascinated with what our bodies truly look like on the insides. I also got to talk to surgeons and hear about how they got to where they were. I got a lot of good advice I will forever use in order to make better decisions. will always be thankful to my high school because of this amazing opportunity I was able to have as a high schooler. 
	Another important professional experience I have was another program my school offered. Although this program was stationed on our schools' campus it was still a professional setting. In this program, we had a model hospital which was the result of two combined classes. There were different stations in each space of the classroom. For example, there was a medical billing/coding area. In this area, we took care of billing for the imaginary patients. There were other sections like surgery, CNA, etc. This program was also another great learning experience as to what my future could possibly look like. In this program, we also wore scrubs as if it was the real deal. 
	Another professional experience I had again, was at my high school. The program was called the Senior Peer Mediation Program. In this program as a senior, I was able to mentor a couple of students that were younger than me. We kept track of their grades and checked in on them once a week to make sure they were doing okay. We usually kept a file with their progress for each and then went to their classrooms to speak to them. I liked this program because I felt like it was a way of giving back to my school and also helping people that might be going through what I went through at their age. Im not sure if I was able to get through to a lot of kids but I hope I was able to get through to at least one of them. I considered this as a professional experience because I actually was in charge of people and their progress was my responsibility.
